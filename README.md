### Day 0: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Committed and  MyWeatherApp repo on GitHub; added API constants for local development; and fixed Alert response JSX and Forecast css.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with getting the right css for my Forecast tab page, but eventually through trial and error with Flexbox properties, I got it to look the way I wanted it.

**Link to work:** [MyWeatherApp](https://github.com/lisajacobson/MyWeatherApp)

### Day 1: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some crowdsourcing on Twitter to get more ideas of apps to build; learned some NodeJS on Udemy; and started a bookmarking app at my friend's suggestion.

**Thoughts:** Node seems really great and I'm excited to learn more and be able to start creating fullstack apps with JS.

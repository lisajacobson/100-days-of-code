### Day 1: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Committed and  MyWeatherApp repo on GitHub; added API constants for local development; and fixed Alert response JSX and Forecast css.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with getting the right css for my Forecast tab page, but eventually through trial and error with Flexbox properties, I got it to look the way I wanted it.

**Link to work:** [MyWeatherApp](https://github.com/lisajacobson/MyWeatherApp)

### Day 2: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some crowdsourcing on Twitter to get more ideas of apps to build; learned some NodeJS on Udemy; and started a bookmarking app at my friend's suggestion.

**Thoughts:** Node seems really great and I'm excited to learn more and be able to start creating fullstack apps with JS.

### Day 3: July 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through a NodeJS course on Udemy; building a notes command line app with CRUD; have used yargs, process.argv, and file system modules; and learned how to export modules from one component to another and import modules into components.

**Thoughts:** Node is a lot of fun and the fact that it's written in JS makes it that much easier to learn. Also, I forgot how fun command line apps can be to build.

**Work:** ![app.js](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7946801/86828072-c30ca280-c060-11ea-9b3d-351496a19b43.png)   ![notes.js](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7946801/86828074-c30ca280-c060-11ea-9c75-204c070e2de0.png)

*due to work work, I wasn't able to make the time the past few days, so I am counting the days starting with when I was able to pick things back up*

### Day 4
**Today's Progress**: I wrapped up the notes command line app I was building using Node JS. It has 4 commands that allow you to add a note, read a single note, list all notes (titles and contents), and remove a particular note. I used the chalk module to play with colors and highlight the outputs, which made it more aesthetically pleasing to read what's logged to the console as a result of each command.

**Thoughts:** My first foray into Node was a simple command line app that was more for learning than for the resulting app itself. Through the exercise, I learned some more JS, as well. I got more practice using the filter and find methods on arrays, and learned that find is more efficient because it stops at every point where your function *finds* a match (or non-match, depending on how your code is written).

**Work:** screen cast coming soon!
